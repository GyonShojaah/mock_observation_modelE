[0] Requirements

 - Python
 - Numpy
 - netcdf4-python


[1] Set up

    Copy 0_setup.py to setup.py and edit:
        cp 0_setup.py setup.py 

    Make output directory, e.g.,
        mkdir out


[2] Prepare data files

    Make sure your data file exists at s_atmFile. 
    Make sure your cross-section data files exist at s_xsFile_Tag. 
    Make sure the output directory s_outFile_Dir has been created. 

[3] Prepare cross-section table

    Currently, the default cross section tables are stored at:
        https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-UiefXUNMcpU1dQYVN4SjlaVmc
    Download the files for the molecules you include. 


[4] Execute

    Type:
        python main_transmission_modelE.py

    The new directory to store the input parameters and the results is
    created in out/. If the directory already exists, you will be asked if
    you overwrite. 


[5] Done !

    The results are:

        out/(s_outFile_Tag)/transit_Heff_depth --- original resolution
        out/(s_outFile_Tag)/transit_Heff_depth_R(resolution) --- specified resolution

    1st column: wavelength       [um]
    2nd column: effective height [km]
    3rd column: transit depth    [ppm]
