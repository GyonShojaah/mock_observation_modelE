[1] Set up

    Copy 0_setup.py to setup.py and edit. 
    Type:
        cp 0_setup.py setup.py 


[2] Prepare data files

    Make sure your data file exists at DATAFILE. 
    Make sure your cross-section data files exist at XSFILE_TAG. 


[3] Execute

    Type:
        python main_transmission_modelE.py

    The new directory to store the input parameters and the results is
    created in out/. If the directory already exists, you will be asked if
    you overwrite. 


[4] Done !

    The results are:

        out/(OUTFILE_TAG)/transit_Heff_depth --- original resolution
        out/(OUTFILE_TAG)/transit_Heff_depth_R(resolution) --- specified resolution

    1st column: wavelength       [um]
    2nd column: effective height [km]
    3rd column: transit depth    [ppm]
